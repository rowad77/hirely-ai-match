   - Add proper error states to all components making API calls

3. Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Create error message components with actionable information
   - Add recovery options where possible

**Files to Modify**:
- Create `/src/utils/error-handling.ts`
- Update API calls in components and services

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Objective**: Improve application performance, especially for lists and data-heavy pages.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Add virtualized lists for jobs, applications using `@tanstack/react-virtual`
   - Optimize rendering of job listings

2. Optimize image loading
   - Add lazy loading for images
   - Implement proper image sizing and WebP format

3. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Review and optimize current lazy loading implementation
   - Add Suspense boundaries for better loading states

**Files to Modify**:
- Update job listing components
- Add virtualization to long lists

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create standardized API response handlers
   - Implement consistent response processing
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses

2. Refactor duplicate code
   - Identify and extract common patterns into reusable hooks or utilities
   - Create shared components for repeated UI patterns

3. Enhance type safety
   - Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Implement strict type checking

**Files to Modify**:
- Create `/src/types/api-responses.ts`
- Update service files and components using API calls

## Phase 2: Feature Enhancements (3-4 weeks)

   - Add personalized job recommendations on dashboard

3. Add search history and saved searches
   - Create UI for viewing and managing search history
   - Implement notifications for new jobs matching saved searches

**Files to Modify**:
- Enhance `/src/components/JobFilters.tsx`
- Create new components for advanced search features
- Update job listing pages

### 2. Enhanced Resume Builder

**Objective**: Create an interactive resume builder with templates and ATS optimization.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design and implement resume builder UI
   - Create multi-step form for resume creation
   - Implement drag-and-drop sections using `@hello-pangea/dnd`
   - Add real-time preview

2. Add resume templates
   - Design multiple professional templates
   - Implement template switching

3. Enhance resume analysis
   - Extend current `ResumeAnalyzer` component
   - Add ATS optimization suggestions
   - Implement keyword matching with job descriptions

**Files to Modify**:
- Create new components in `/src/components/resume/`
- Enhance `/src/components/ResumeAnalyzer.tsx`
- Create resume template components

### 3. Messaging System

**Objective**: Implement a direct messaging system between candidates and employers.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design and implement messaging UI
   - Create conversation list and message thread components
   - Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

2. Add interview scheduling
   - Create calendar integration
   - Implement interview request and confirmation workflow

3. Implement notification preferences
   - Add settings for message notifications
   - Create email notification templates

**Files to Create**:
- `/src/components/messaging/`
- `/src/hooks/use-messaging.ts`
- Supabase functions for messaging notifications

## Phase 3: Scalability Improvements (2-3 weeks)

### 1. Database Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize database queries and structure for better performance.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Review and optimize database indexes
   - Analyze query patterns
   - Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields

2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add caching layer using React Query's caching capabilities
   - Optimize data fetching strategies

**Files to Modify**:
- Database migration scripts
- Data fetching hooks and services

### 2. Monitoring and Logging

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Set up application logging
   - Implement structured logging
   - Add performance tracking for critical operations

2. Create monitoring dashboard
   - Implement error tracking
   - Add performance monitoring for key user flows

**Files to Create**:
- `/src/utils/logging.ts`
- Monitoring configuration

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2**: API Error Handling and initial Performance Optimizations
